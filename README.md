General Information

This project explores how coding can be used as a creative tool for making music. It combines Python programming with musical composition to create an interactive experience that allows users to generate or modify simple music patterns using code.

Purpose:
To make coding more playful, artistic, and accessible to beginners, showing that programming can be a creative medium, not just a technical skill.

Problem it solves:
Many beginners find coding intimidating and music that reflects mood can be hard to find. This project aims to break that barrier by introducing code in a fun, musical, and engaging way.

Why I undertook it:
I wanted to explore creative coding and express music through programming while learning how Python and Tkinter can be used for interactive art-based projects.

Technologies Used

- Python – Version 3.14

- EarSketch – Online platform and Python library for music-based coding

- Tkinter – Python GUI library for creating the interactive interface

- IDLE – Python’s integrated development and learning environment

Features

- Music generation using Python code via EarSketch

- Interactive interface built with Tkinter

- Combines logic, creativity, and sound design
  
- Users can select mood from happy, sad, calm

Setup
Requirements

- Python 3.14

- Tkinter (pre-installed with Python)

1. Navigate to the 'MoodMusicApp' Zip file and open
   
3. Ensure mood_music.py and audio files happy.wav, sad.wav, calm.wav are in there
   
4. Run the project (mood_music.py) in IDLE or any Python IDE by simply opening it

5. Once the mood_music.py file is opened, click Run at top left corner (on mac) > Run Module or F5

Note: Please unzip the entire "MoodMusicApp" folder before running mood_music.py.
The program depends on the "audio" folder being in the same directory to access the sound.

Usage

Once the program is running, the Tkinter window will open.
Users can:

- Press buttons to play pre-coded sounds or loops.

- Observe how code changes affect the musical output in real-time.

Project Status

Project is: Complete

Areas for improvement:

- Improve the visual design of the Tkinter interface

- Add more user interactivity (e.g., sliders, sound previews)

Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by EarSketch’s “Code with Music” program.
Thanks to the EarSketch team for providing accessible music coding tools and tutorials.
Special thanks to classmates and tutors for their creative feedback and coding support.
